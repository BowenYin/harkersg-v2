    <p class="md-title">About</p>
    <p>This is a free resource mainly for study guides and notes, coded by me and not to be duplicated, copied, or remade in any way. I take no responsibility for the content that is submitted to this site.</p>
    <p><i>Important:</i> Do not submit any test questions or graded assignments, as students from lower grades may see them.</p>
    <span><b>Flag Guidelines:</b></span>
    <span><ol>
      <li>You will receive a flag if you flag something that's not spam or if you submit spam.</li>
      <li>Add Folders: 1 flag or less</li>
      <li>Flag, Add Teachers: 2 flags or less</li>
      <li>Add Study Guides: 3 flags or less</li>
      <li>The number of flags you have is displayed under your profile name.</li>
    </ol></span>
    <p><u>A Note About Study Guide Collections:</u> The first thing you will notice when visiting the Study Guides page is how long it is. This is on purpose. All the study guides are on one page because that is the fastest and <i>only</i> way you can open up to more study guides. (There are ample sorting and filter features that you can use also.) If they were in folders, you would first have to click on it to open, then you would be limited to only a few study guides. I will still add subfolders in the future, but at least you won't be saying "I never knew there was a study guide on this!" when you didn't navigate to other subject folders.</p><br>
    <span class="md-title">Planned Features</span>
    <span><ul>
      <li>HarkerSG is VERY slow on Firefox. I'm working to make it faster. Average Study Guides page load times: Chrome=4 sec. Safari=2 sec. Firefox=15 sec. Long story short, don't use Firefox.</li>
      <li>Add public traffic analytics to left side navigation panel.</li>
      <li>Upload files as study guides.</li>
			<li>Redesign of study guide UX, including selecting courses first, then viewing SGs.
      <li>Chrome extension (low priority)</li>
      <li><i>To suggest new features or report a bug, use the feedback form.</i></li>
