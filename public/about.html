    <h3>About HarkerSG</h3>
    <p>HarkerSG is a free resource where students submit their study guides/notes so that others can benefit from them. HarkerSG was created so you will never have to say "I never knew there was a study guide for this!" again.</p>
    <p><em>Important:</em> Make sure your study guides do not contain previous test questions, graded assignments, or confidential material, as future students may see and use them. By submitting a study guide and checking the box, you ensure that your study guide follows the Harker honor code. I am not responsible for any content that is submitted to this site.</p>
